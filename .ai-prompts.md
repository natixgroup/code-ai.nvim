# Refactor 

Propose a way to factorize the askHeavy() methods in one file.
Describe the modification actions I have to do in the code in order to achieve that.

# Print Gemini tokens

In `lua/ai/gemini/query.lua`, we have the `formatResult` function that prints "This is Gemini answer" 
followed by the `result` variable.

I want the used tokens to be printed as well between parentheses after the "This is Gemini answer" string.
For example, if the prompt tokens are 30000 and the answer token is 2000 the output should be:
"This is Gemini answer (30k in, 2k out)".

Gemini response body is a JSON object that I saved as `gemini-response.json`.

Propose a modified version of the `formatResult` function that achieves that,
and explain the modifications with inline comments.

# Print ChatGPT tokens

In `lua/ai/chatgpt/query.lua`, we have the `formatResult` function that prints "This is ChatGPT answer" 
followed by the `result` variable.

I want the used tokens to be printed as well between parentheses after the "This is Gemini answer" string.
For example, if the prompt tokens are 30000 and the answer token is 2000 the output should be:
"This is ChatGPT answer (30k in, 2k out)".

Gemini response body is a JSON object that I saved as `chatgpt-response.json`.

Propose a modified version of the `formatResult` function that achieves that,

# Global refactorize

Propose modifications to the code in order to make it more maintainable and readable.

# Introduce exclusion in `.ai-scanned-files`

Currently, the `.ai-scanned-files` file contains a list of glob patterns that are used to get a list of files to be scanned.

I want to introduce a way to exclude files from the scan.

I am going to change the format of the `.ai-scanned-files` file to include:
- a line starting with `+` followed by a glob pattern to include files
- a line starting with `-` followed by a glob pattern to exclude files

For example, the file could look like this:


```
-lua/ai/aiconfig.lua
+lua/**/*.lua
+*.json
-chatgpt-response.json
```

This file should be read by the  `aiconfig.getScannedFiles` function to get the list of files to be scanned:
- First consider only the `+` patterns in order to get the list of files to be included
- Then consider the `-` patterns in order to exclude files from the list
- Finally, return the list of files to be scanned

Propose a modified version of the `aiconfig.getScannedFiles` function that achieves that,
